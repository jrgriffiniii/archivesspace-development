				books Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation: A History of Literary Paris in the
				Twenties and Thirties(1983) and Walks in Hemingway's Paris: A Guide for the Literary
				Traveler(1990), as well as her thesis, dissertation, and other writings about Sylvia
				Beach (1887-1962), the American proprietress of the bookshop Shakespeare and Company
				in Paris, France. Included are research files, notes, typescripts, and galleys for
				Fitch's biography of Beach; correspondence and transcripts of interviews with former
				friends and associates of Beach, such as Berenice Abbott, Morrill Cody, Malcolm

				Monnier, and typed copies of McDougall's A Selection of Poems(1957); as well as

				Helen Eddy, Marthiel Mathews, François Valéry, Priscilla Veitch, and others
				reminiscing about Beach and Paris in the 1920s and 1930s. There are also notes,
				manuscript drafts, and galleys of Fitch's Walks in Hemingway's Paris: A Guide for
				the Literary Traveler, and a cassette tape of an interview with Dutch journalists

				Fitch; a copy of Lisa MacFarlane's Princeton University thesis on Sylvia Beach
				entitled "For Who is Silvier" (1979); four unpublished writings by Fitch (1988);
				additional correspondence between Fitch and her literary agents, friends, and fans
				primarily relating to Fitch's books concerning Lost Generation authors; and a
				photograph of photographs hanging in Shakespeare and Company.</p>
            <p> The original papers of Sylvia Beach include letters by Beach to her parents and
				sisters (1898-1952); letters by other family members and friends (1858-1954); a
				photograph album showing Sylvia and Holly Beach in Italy and Serbia (1917-1920);
				scrapbook pages of photographs and memorabilia (ca.1932-1949); a typescript draft,
				with autograph corrections (removed from Fitch's research files), and revised
				galleys for Beach's book Shakespeare and Company(1959); reviews of the book;
				cassette tapes of Beach's interview with Jackson Mathews for the Kenyon Review
				(1960); a scrapbook of obituaries(1962); letters sent to Holly Beach (Mrs. Frederic
				Dennis) (1962-1964); and correspondence regarding Sylvia Beach's estate
				(1962-1962).</p>
            <p> An additional accession consists of several typescript versions of "Voyage to
				Ithaca: William Carlos Williams in Paris," with holograph corrections, annotations,
				and additions by Fitch; and correspondence with Else Albrecht-Carrie, Donald Gallup,
				James Laughlin, Marilyn V. Schuler, Emily Wallace, and Mrs. William Carlos Williams,

            <p> The bulk of these photographs passed from Beatrix Potter to a family member at her death. They came into the possession of Beatrix Potter's cousin-once-removed Stephanie Duke and, after her death, into that of her husband, and still later into that of Col. Duke's second wife, Joan Duke. They were consigned to auction either by Joan Duke or her heirs. They were purchased at Sotheby's London EXCALIBUR 29/30 Nov 1989, lot 168, by Justin Schiller acting for Lloyd Cotsen. [information provided by email from Ivy Trent and Anne Wright]. In 2006, Cotsen made a gift of the photographs to the Library.</p>
            <p> A number of photographs were acquired individually for the Cotsen Children's Library but have been united with this group; their original Cotsen accession numbers are noted in the item-level descriptions of the photographs.</p>

            <p>The Lloyd E. Cotsen collection of Potter Family photographs consists primarily of photographs taken by Rupert Potter (1832-1914), father of children's book author Beatrix Potter (1866-1944). Rupert Potter was a prolific amateur photographer who made many portraits of Beatrix, of family members, and of friends. He also photographed the landscape of the Lake District, Cumbria, England, where the family spent their summers. In addition to Rupert Potter's photographs, the collection includes studio portraits of Potter family members taken by various commercial photographers; a few photographs taken by Beatrix as aids for illustration; and photographs of animals and farmsteads in the Lake District related to Beatrix Potter Heelis' career as sheep farmer and land preservationist from the 1910s to 1940s. The Cotsen Children's Library also houses a wide array of drawings, manuscripts, correspondence, printed works, merchandise, and ephemera related to the life and career of Beatrix Potter. Some of these materials, along with the photographs, are described in Margit Sperling Cotsen, The Beatrix Potter Collection of Lloyd Cotsen (Cotsen Occasional Press, 2004).</p>
            <p> The collection comprises approximately 1300 items. Almost all are photographic prints, including albumen prints; platinum prints; gelatin or collodion printing out prints; and silver gelatin developing out prints. Also included are a group of photographs of Bertram Potter's landscape paintings, and several envelopes originally used to store groups of photos.</p>
         </scopecontent>
         <arrangement>
            <p>The photographs are arranged according to three series. The first series consists of portraits, which are arranged in the sequence used to describe them in the printed catalog of the Cotsen Potter collection. That is, they are arranged by portrait subject, and by date within each subject group. Although this mode of classification has the disadvantage of separating groups of images that were made on the same occasion with different subjects, every effort has been made to note such cross-references in the database entries. Photographs of animals are included in this series.</p>
            <p> Rupert Potter's landscape photographs are arranged in chronological order and constitute the second series. Rupert Potter inscribed full dates on most of his photographs. Photographs that are dated only by month and year are filed at the end of the month to which they belong. Photographs dated only by year are filed at the end of the year to which they belong. Photographs from the same date in different formats are arranged smallest to largest, except when a smaller photograph is a cropped version of a print from a larger negative. In the latter case, the smaller print is filed immediately after the larger print from the same negative. At the end of this series is a small group of unsigned landscape images that cannot be confidently attributed.</p>
            <p> The landscape series is followed by the third and final series, a group of photographs of Bertram Potter's landscape paintings.</p>

               <p>Rupert Potter's landscape photographs constitute the second series and are arranged in chronological order. Rupert Potter inscribed full dates on most of his photographs. Photographs that are dated only by month and year are filed at the end of the month to which they belong. Photographs dated only by year are filed at the end of the year to which they belong. Photographs from the same date in different formats are arranged smallest to largest, except when a smaller photograph is a cropped version of a print from a larger negative. In the latter case, the smaller print is filed immediately after the larger print from the same negative. At the end of this series is a small group of unsigned landscape images that cannot be confidently attributed.</p>

                  <p>Photographed during Lingholm stay. Title supplied from inscription. Inscribed in pencil by Rupert Potter: Rash Judgments/ Sep 8 1899/ R Potter/ Rydal Lake/ from N West. Title is a quotation from Wordsworth. Either from Tintern Abbey: Neither evil tongues, rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all the dreary intercourse of daily life, shall ever prevail against us. Or taken from Poems on the Naming of Places: IV, first line: A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags... ending: and POINT RASH-JUDGMENT is the name it bears. However, the latter poem refers to a location on Grasmere.</p>

                  <p>Cataloger supplied title. Inscribed in pencil by Rupert Potter: W.B. Potter / April 1904. Inscribed in ink, unknown hand: at Hill Top Farm / July 1948. Rupert Potter's inscription on two of the photographs in this group, absent any other marks of authorship, suggests the possibility that he made all of the photographs of Bertram's paintings. No external evidence is available to confirm this . Ink inscription of 1948 relates to the location of the paintings at that date, not to the date or location at which photographs were made.</p>

Rupert Potter's inscription on two of the photographs in this group, absent any other marks of authorship, suggests the possibility that he made all of the photographs of Bertrams paintings. Possibly made at same time as CTSN Potter 1281, dated Apr 1904; though printed on a different paper, film format and setting appear the same. No external evidence is available to confirm this .</p>
